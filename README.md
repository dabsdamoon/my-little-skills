# my-little-skills

A curated Codex and Claude Code plugin marketplace that bundles [Anthropic's official skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) with custom-built skills for developer workflows, document processing, design, and project-specific automation.

## Quick Start

### Claude Code

Register this marketplace:
```
/plugin marketplace add dabsdamoon/my-little-skills
```

Browse and install plugins:
```
/plugin
```
Then go to the **Discover** tab, or install directly:
```
/plugin install <plugin-name>@my-little-skills
```

### Codex

Connect the GitHub marketplace and install a plugin once for the current user:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add dabsdamoon/my-little-skills --ref main
codex plugin add developer-workflow-skills@my-little-skills
```

The installed plugin is available in every repository opened by that user. Codex stores plugin configuration and cache data under `CODEX_HOME`, which defaults to `~/.codex`; installation is not shared automatically with other operating-system accounts.

Run the shared update primitive at any time:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace upgrade my-little-skills
```

This refreshes the Git-backed marketplace and its installed plugins. The platform adapters below schedule this same command; they do not edit application repositories.

## Automatic Codex Updates

Clone this repository on each machine where updates should be scheduled, connect the marketplace as shown above, and run the adapter for that operating system. Each adapter captures the current `codex` executable and `CODEX_HOME`, runs once at login or user-manager startup, and checks daily afterward.

### Windows

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\install-codex-marketplace-updater.ps1 -RunNow
```

This installs the per-user Task Scheduler task `Codex-MyLittleSkills-Upgrade`. To target a non-default profile, pass `-CodexHome C:\path\to\codex-home`. To remove it:

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\uninstall-codex-marketplace-updater.ps1
```

### macOS

```bash
sh scripts/install-codex-marketplace-updater.sh --run-now
```

This installs `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.dabsdamoon.codex-my-little-skills-upgrade.plist`. A LaunchAgent runs for the signed-in user. For an unattended macOS service account, provision an equivalent LaunchDaemon through the machine's administration tooling.

### Linux

```bash
sh scripts/install-codex-marketplace-updater.sh --run-now
```

This installs and enables the systemd user timer `codex-my-little-skills-upgrade.timer`. On a headless server, run the installer as the account that owns the Codex installation and keep that user's systemd manager active:

```bash
sudo loginctl enable-linger <service-account>
```

For macOS or Linux with a non-default profile, pass `--codex-home /path/to/codex-home`. Remove either POSIX adapter with:

```bash
sh scripts/uninstall-codex-marketplace-updater.sh
```

The updater logs to `$CODEX_HOME/log/marketplace-updates.log` and keeps one rotated backup. Push plugin changes to the tracked branch and keep the version and core metadata aligned across both plugin manifests. New Codex sessions load the refreshed plugin; restart Codex if an update is not detected in an existing session.

## What's Included from Upstream

This marketplace tracks [anthropics/skills](https://github.com/anthropics/skills) as an upstream remote. The following skills come directly from Anthropic's official repository:

algorithmic-art, brand-guidelines, canvas-design, claude-api, doc-coauthoring, docx, frontend-design, internal-comms, mcp-builder, pdf, pptx, skill-creator, slack-gif-creator, theme-factory, web-artifacts-builder, webapp-testing, xlsx

To sync with upstream:
```bash
git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

## Custom Skills

These skills are original to this marketplace — not available in Anthropic's official repo.

| **pr-creator** | Generates PR documentation with blast radius analysis (how many files depend on your changes) and OWASP security scanning of the diff |
| **setup-release-pipeline** | Sets up an opinionated production-pointer release workflow for branch-tracking hosts: `main` stays latest-code/release-candidate, `production` is the live branch, and `run_deploy.sh` ships explicitly without deploy secrets |
| **deploy-check** | Checks deployment readiness and records a concise deploy report |
| **docker-ram-checker** | Tests Docker container memory usage before deploying to Cloud Run, ECS, or Kubernetes |
| **prompt-optimizer** | Reduces token usage and improves cache efficiency for production LLM prompts |

## Creating a New Skill

Each skill is a folder with a `SKILL.md`:

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: "When and how to trigger this skill"
---

# Instructions for Claude here...
```

To bundle skills into a dual-compatible plugin, create `plugins/<name>/.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and `plugins/<name>/.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, then add the plugin to `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Keep their versions and core metadata aligned; the Codex manifest can additionally contain its required `interface` metadata.
