# Japanese Resume Best Practices (日本の履歴書・職務経歴書)

## Document Types

In Japan, there are typically two distinct documents used in job applications:

### 履歴書 (Rirekisho) - Standard Resume

- Often uses pre-printed forms or standardized templates
- Includes personal information, educational background, work history, and qualifications
- Typically handwritten for traditional companies, though typed versions are increasingly accepted
- Size: A3 (folded to A4) or B4 (folded to B5)

### 職務経歴書 (Shokumukeirekisho) - Career History Document
- More detailed, free-form document focusing on professional experience
- Highlights specific achievements, skills, and project experience
- Always typed/printed
- Size: A4 (1-2 pages typical, up to 3 for experienced professionals)
- More common for mid-career professionals and technical positions

### Format Options

- Most common format

**逆編年体式 (Reverse Chronological Format)**
- Lists most recent experience first
- Emphasizes current skills and recent achievements
- Popular for technical roles

**キャリア式 (Functional/Skill-based Format)**
- Organizes by skill area or project type rather than chronology
- Good for career changers or those with diverse experience
- Less common in Japan

### Recommended Structure

**1. Title and Basic Information**
- Document title: 職務経歴書
- Date: YYYY年MM月DD日現在
- Name: [Your name]

**2. Professional Summary (職務要約)**
- Brief overview (3-5 lines) of career history
- Total years of experience
- Key areas of expertise

**3. Detailed Work History (職務経歴)**

For each position:
- Period: YYYY年MM月～YYYY年MM月 (or 現在)
- Company name (会社名)
- Company description (brief): industry, size, business type
- Position/Title (役職/職種)
- Department/Division (所属部署)

**Responsibilities (職務内容):**
- Use bullet points
- Be specific about role and scope

**5. Self-PR (自己PR)**

**⚠️ IMPORTANT for Technical Roles (AI/ML, Engineering, Data Science):**
- **MINIMIZE or SKIP this section** - Modern technical resumes prioritize achievements over personal statements
- If included, limit to 1-2 sentences focusing on technical domain expertise and scale
- **AVOID generic statements** about "passion" (情熱), "responsibility" (責任感), or personality traits
- Focus on quantifiable technical achievements and business impact instead
- Space is better used for additional project details or technical skills

**For Non-Technical Roles:**
- 2-3 concise paragraphs (shorter than traditional)
- Connect past experience to target position with specific examples
- Highlight unique strengths with quantifiable achievements
- Show understanding of company/role needs
- Avoid flowery language - be direct and fact-based

## Formatting Guidelines

### Font and Typography
- Font: MS Mincho (明朝体) for body text, MS Gothic (ゴシック体) for headings
- Size: 10-11pt for body, 12-14pt for headings
- Line spacing: 1.0-1.5
- Emphasis: Bold for headings, avoid italics (not natural in Japanese)

### Layout
- Margins: 20-30mm on all sides
- Alignment: Left-aligned for most content
- Tables: Use for structured information in rirekisho
- White space: Ensure readability, not too cramped

### Language and Tone
- Use formal, polite language (です・ます調)
- Avoid overly casual expressions
- Use humble forms when describing your own actions (謙譲語)
- Be concise and direct - avoid flowery language
- Use appropriate business terminology (ビジネス用語)

## Cultural Considerations

### Humility vs. Self-Promotion
- Balance Japanese humility with need to showcase achievements
- Focus on contributions to team/company rather than personal glory
- Use phrases like "貢献した" (contributed to) rather than "達成した" (achieved)

### Job Changes
- Frequent job changes may be viewed negatively in traditional industries
- Explain reasons for changes briefly and positively
- Emphasize skills gained and continuity of career development

### Personal Information
- While personal photos and some personal information are standard, be mindful of privacy
- Marital status and family details are becoming less common
- Focus on professional qualifications

### Attention to Detail
- Errors or corrections are viewed very negatively
- Ensure perfect accuracy in dates, names, and details
- Neat, clean presentation is essential
- For handwritten rirekisho: use black ink, no corrections

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Using wrong date format**: Use consistent era system (Western calendar recommended for international companies)
2. **Inconsistent formatting**: Maintain uniform date formats, spacing, and style throughout
3. **Too lengthy**: Keep shokumukeirekisho to 2 pages maximum for most cases
4. **Vague descriptions**: Be specific about responsibilities and achievements
5. **Untranslated technical terms**: Use Japanese terms or provide Japanese explanation for foreign concepts
6. **Missing furigana**: Always include readings for names and potentially ambiguous kanji
7. **Casual language**: Maintain formal business Japanese throughout
8. **Poor quality photo**: Use professional, recent photo in business attire

## Date Format Examples

**Japanese Era (年号)**
- 令和5年4月 (Reiwa 5, April) = April 2023
- 平成31年3月 (Heisei 31, March) = March 2019

**Western Calendar (西暦)**
- 2023年4月 (preferred for international companies)
- April 2023 (in English sections if any)

**Consistency**: Choose one format and use throughout the document

## File Naming Convention

When creating Word documents:
- Rirekisho: `履歴書_[Your Name]_YYYYMMDD.docx`
- Shokumukeirekisho: `職務経歴書_[Your Name]_YYYYMMDD.docx`

Example: `職務経歴書_山田太郎_20231115.docx`
