### 6. Self-Introduction (자기소개)

**⚠️ IMPORTANT for Technical Roles (AI/ML, Engineering, Data Science):**
- **SKIP or MINIMIZE this section** - Modern technical resumes focus on achievements, not personal narratives
- If included, limit to 1-2 sentences about technical domain expertise and scale of work
- **AVOID generic statements** about "passion" (열정), "sense of responsibility" (책임감), or personality descriptions
- Valuable resume space is better used for technical projects, metrics, and achievements
- If a company requires 자기소개서 separately, handle it there, not on the resume

**For Non-Technical Roles:**
Some resumes include a brief self-introduction section:
- 2-3 concise sentences (keep shorter than traditional)
- Highlight key quantifiable achievements
- Show motivation and fit for the position
- Professional tone with specific examples, not generic traits

Note: Many companies request a separate detailed 자기소개서 (personal statement), so this section may be brief or omitted from the resume.

## Formatting Guidelines

### Visual Layout
- Clean, professional design
- Use tables or structured layout for personal information
- Consistent spacing and alignment
- Section headers clearly distinguished
- White space for readability

### Font and Typography
- Font: 맑은 고딕 (Malgun Gothic), 나눔고딕 (Nanum Gothic), or 바탕 (Batang) for body text
- Size: 10-11pt for body text, 12-14pt for headings, 9pt for fine print
- Emphasis: Bold for section headings and company/school names
- Color: Black for text, dark gray or navy blue for headings (professional colors only)

### Language and Tone
- Use formal, polite Korean (존댓말 in certain contexts)
- Use appropriate business terminology
- Be concise and direct
- Avoid overly casual language or slang
- Use humble expressions when describing achievements but don't undersell

## Cultural Considerations

### Age and Seniority
- Date of birth is important as age affects workplace hierarchy in Korean culture
- Career progression is often evaluated relative to age
- Graduation dates help employers understand your career timeline

### Military Service (for males)
- Military service status is always included and considered important
- Completion shows responsibility and is often required
- Exemption should be noted with reason if asked

### Education Emphasis
- Educational background carries significant weight in Korea
- University name and major are particularly important
- Alumni networks (선후배) can be influential

### Company Loyalty vs. Career Growth
- Job hopping is becoming more accepted, especially in tech and startups
- Traditional industries may still prefer longer tenures
- Frame job changes positively: career development, skill acquisition

### Personal Information and Photos
- More personal information is standard compared to Western resumes
- Professional photo is expected and influences first impression
- Appearance and presentation matter significantly

### Relationship to Company
- Show understanding of company culture and values
- Emphasize team collaboration (팀워크)
- Highlight ability to contribute to company goals

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Poor quality or inappropriate photo**: Use recent, professional photo in business attire
2. **Inconsistent date formatting**: Use consistent format throughout (YYYY.MM.DD recommended)
3. **Vague descriptions**: Be specific about roles, responsibilities, and achievements
4. **Typos or errors**: Proofread carefully; errors suggest carelessness
5. **Too lengthy**: Keep concise, typically 2-3 pages maximum unless very experienced
6. **Missing military service**: Males must include this information
7. **Unprofessional email**: Use professional email address (avoid nicknames)
8. **Overly decorative design**: Keep professional and conservative unless applying to creative field
9. **Informal language**: Maintain formal business Korean
10. **Omitting GPA**: Include if above 3.5/4.5 or 3.0/4.0; explain if lower

## Date and Age Format

**Korean Dating System:**
- Format: YYYY.MM.DD or YYYY년 MM월 DD일
- Example: 1990.05.15 or 1990년 5월 15일

**Age:**
- Use Korean age (traditional, adds 1-2 years to international age) or international age
- Increasingly, international age system is preferred
- Birth year alone is often sufficient

**Period Notation:**
- Use ~ or - for date ranges
- Example: 2020.03 ~ 2023.02 or 2020.03 - 2023.02
- Current: ~현재 or ~재직 중

## File Naming Convention

**Format:**
- 이력서_[Name]_YYYYMMDD.docx
- Example: 이력서_김철수_20231115.docx

**Alternative for international companies:**
- Resume_[Name]_YYYYMMDD.docx
- Example: Resume_KimChulsu_20231115.docx

## 자기소개서 (Personal Statement) - If Requested Separately

Many Korean companies request a detailed personal statement in addition to the resume:

**Common prompts:**
1. Growth experiences (성장 과정)
2. Personality strengths and weaknesses (성격의 장단점)
3. Motivation for applying (지원 동기)
4. Future goals and plans (입사 후 포부)

**Format:**
- Usually 1,000-2,000 characters per prompt
